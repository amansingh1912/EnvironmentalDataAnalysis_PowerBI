#### Tools Used: Power BI, Figma

After loading the dataset in Power BI, I applied the following applications.

## Understanding of Data:

The dataset contain several KPIs like Asthma, Heavy Precipitation, Air Toxin Concentration & Human Exposure to Contaminants on which I analysed the data.



## Application of DAX measures:
I applied one DAX measure here in the dataset i.e. DISTINCTCOUNT here.

## Visualization in Power BI:

I splitted the visuals in 5 pages i.e 

* Overview
* Asthma: 
* Heavy Precipitation
* Air Toxin Concentration
* Human Exposure to contaminants

### Theme and Color Palette:
* Light theme
* Colors chosen were: Green, blue, White, black

### Visualization:
Here, I used Figma for creating layout for background which is 16:9 i.e. 720*1280 px

## Conclusion:
Overall, it was a good dataset to analyse and it gave me good understanding of data and improving at storytelling
